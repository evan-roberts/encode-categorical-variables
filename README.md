# Encode categorical variables ready for machine learning

**Transform categorical variables into numerical values ready to be used as inputs for a machine learning model.**

When preparing data to be used in a machine learning model, there are many things we need to do. One of these things is to transform categorical variables into numerical values. This is because most models don’t understand strings of categorical data.

There are a few ways to go about doing this as you’ll see later on. But first, open the Jupyter Notebook in this repository.
